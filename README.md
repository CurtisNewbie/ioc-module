# ioc-module

Simple Dependency injection module **for me** to learn how it is implemented (for learning purposes).

I do **try** to mimic how popular frameworks implement DI, and for sure mine is gonna be implemented terriably, and contains so many mistakes. My plan is to write something that kinda works, then continue to read the source cocde, and see how they fix the issues I have faced. :D
