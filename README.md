# ioc-module

Simple Dependency injection module **for me** to learn how it is implemented (for learning purposes).

I do **try** to mimic how popular frameworks (such as Spring) implement DI, and for sure mine is gonna be implemented terriably, and contains so many mistakes. My plan is to read the source code, write something that kinda works, and then continue to read the source cocde, and see how they design the whole thing. :D
